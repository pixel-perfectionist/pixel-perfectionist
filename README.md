## Hi there, I’m Alexander Katrukhin! 👋  
**UX Engineer | Design Systems Advocate | AI-Enhanced Front-End Architect**

Welcome to my GitHub! I specialize in building high-impact, scalable design systems and front-end architectures that bridge design and engineering at scale.

### 🚀 About Me

Currently a **Senior UX Engineer at Microsoft**, I work across multiple products like Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive. My focus lies in creating shared UI component libraries, design-engineering tooling, and front-end performance optimizations that improve product consistency, accessibility, and developer velocity.

I combine deep UX sensibility with advanced engineering practices — delivering robust, maintainable, and accessible UI foundations. Lately, I've also been exploring how **AI can enhance the design-to-code workflow**, bringing automation and intelligent tooling to front-end development.
